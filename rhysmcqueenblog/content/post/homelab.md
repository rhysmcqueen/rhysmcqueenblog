# My HomeLab
## This is my homelab that I have built together to help learn new and fun technologys in the IT space. 
### I have learned many technologies using this lab including
- HA Hypervisors (Proxmox)
- Kubernetes, Docker
- Infrastructure as code (Terraform, Ansible)
- Reverse Proxies
- Power managment (2 x UPS')
- Cable Managment 
- Networking (Juniper 48P Poe 10gb Switch)
- IAAC
### Details:
I have my rack tucked away insite a closed in the basement. I decideded to cut a hole in the brand new wall to make it fit. Overall looks very nice and gives a cool vibe.
